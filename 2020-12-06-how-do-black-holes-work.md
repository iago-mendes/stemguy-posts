	description: Nowadays, everyone has heard of the term "black hole", but I am sure that most people do not know the great amount of knowledge humanity has acquired recently. In this post, I talk about black holes – origins, structure, and behavior – and future topics of study regarding this subject.

We live in exciting times for talking about black holes; in a short period of time, humanity has detected the collision of a binary system (proving the existence of gravitational waves), taken the first direct image of a black hole, and proven that the center of our galaxy is one of those objects. If you are excited about this subject – like me – you may have seen this term being used very often recently.

In this context, it is possible that "black hole" has become something mundane for most of us, who take for granted the knowledge we currently have about such an interesting object. In this post, I talk about some topics regarding black holes, in an attempt to exclude the mundanity of this expression.

# Origins: how are black holes created?

We are so used to thinking about the beginning and ending of things that the first question that usually arises when discussing black holes is about their origins. Well, there are more than one possible answer.

## Death of a star

The most common and accepted origin is the death of a star. When a star reaches the end of its life, there are some possible paths to be followed, like becoming a white dwarf, a neutron star or – the one in which we are interested – a black hole. The details of star evolution are way too complex to resume in just some phrases, so I plan on writing another post to dive into this topic.

In short words, the remaining content of a dead star will turn into a black hole if its mass is so big that not even the Pauli exclusion principle (which basically says that two particles cannot occupy the same place at the same time) can prevent the object from collapsing. In this scenario, the mass will keep collapsing eternally, having a volume that tends to zero and – therefore – a density that tends to infinity. The result is a point (no volume) with a huge density value, resulting in an immense gravitational field; this point is called Singularity, but more on that later.

## The Big Bang

I said that the death of a star is the most **common** origin for black holes. In reality, all that is needed for a gravitational collapse to generate a black hole is a great density, which nowadays is found only in stars. However, there was a time in universe history when the space medium was full of high density objects; do you know what time was it? Well, if you said "The Big Bang", you are partially correct; to be more precise, it was in the *radiation dominated era* (less than one second after the Big Bang).

It is worth pointing out that we have no evidence that primordial black holes – which is the name given to results from this origin – exist. Besides, since these objects are not created from stars, their mass can be less than one solar mass, making the detection of these black holes even more difficult.

## Lab collisions

By now, we have only talked about gravitational collapse (a lot of mass in a small volume) as a way to create black holes. However, it is also theoretically possible to create such an object by putting a lot of energy in a small volume (which makes sense if you remember that mass and energy can be converted into each other). In order to accomplish this, we would have to accelerate particles (providing energy) and then collide them, which is basically what particle accelerators like the LHC do.

Be as it may, this act would require a lot of energy, making it unfeasible for our current resources. Furthermore, when talking about this topic, it is common to fear that some black hole is going to be generated in some science lab and destroy the Earth. Don't worry! Even if we were able to create such objects, they would be so small that they would evaporate almost instantaneously because of the Hawking radiation (more on that later).

# Structure and properties: what are black holes made of?

Black holes are very complex objects, being impossible to describe all of their composition details in a short post. Nevertheless, below I talk about some of the most interesting aspects about them in my opinion.

## Singularity

In the center of a black hole, it is believed to exist a singularity: a point (volume zero) with a large amount of mass, creating a curve in the spacetime curvature that tends to infinity – which basically means there is a lot of gravity. For a stellar black hole (originated by the death of a star), the remaining core content after the explosion becomes this structure.

## Event horizon

When a simulation of a black hole is shown in movies or TV shows (like in Interstellar), the most noticeable thing about it is a huge black sphere. Well, now you can call it the event horizon. This sphere is delimited by the Schwarzschild radius, which is the distance at which the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light, meaning that nothing can get out of this region. The value of this radius can be easily calculated using the formula studied by the physicist Karl Schwarzschild.

## Accretion disk

The accretion disk is a region in which there is mass attracted by the black hole. Eventually, fractions of this mass are converted into energy and fall into the event horizon. This conversion process can be calculated using the famous relativity equation developed by Einstein: E=mc². Besides, due to the energy liberated, this is the region we can directly observe, like was done by the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/black-hole-image-makes-history).

# Behavior: what do black holes do?

We have already talked about how black holes are formed and their composition, but what do they actually do? Do they stay put until the end of the universe? No! There are 2 main processes in the "life" of a black hole.

## Growth (accretion of mass)

When learning about black holes, it is hard not to listen that "nothing can escape of a black hole, not even light". That is true; the gravity created around such objects is so enormous that the deformity caused in spacetime makes it impossible for even the fastest particles in the universe – photons – to avoid falling into its center. Therefore, a black hole attracts mass from its surroundings to its accretion disk, which will then be transformed into energy.

## Evaporation (Hawking radiation)

Black holes do not only increase their masses, they also lose it! I know it may sound strange to hear that a black hole can "evaporate" – mainly because of the all-mighty image we create in our heads –, but this is theoretically possible. The scientist responsible to study this phenomenon is no one less than the famous Stephen Hawking (R.I.P.), who never won a Nobel Prize for his studies due to the difficulty of getting experimental proof of such events.

The details of this process are really complex, but we can try to simplify it. Basically, in quantum mechanics, every particle has a pair – called antiparticle – and they pop in and out of existence all the time. The emission occurs when this process (popping in and out) happens in the boundary of the event horizon; in this scenario, the inner particle falls into the center of the black hole while the other particle escapes from it. This escaping particle is what forms the Hawking radiation, decreasing the mass and energy of the black hole.

# Studies: is there more to study about black holes?

After reading so much information about black holes, you may ask: do we still need to study such objects? We most certainly do! Like everything in science, the more you learn about this topic, the more you discover new questions to be answered. If you love talking about black holes, you are in luck because the scientific community has been actively studying them.

## More observations

I am sure you have already seen the above image, right? This is a direct image of the supermassive black hole in the center of the Virgo Galaxy (M87), which marked a great point in history. With this new ability, we have new targets to be observed. In special, the black hole in the center of the Milk Way – Sagittarius A* – is a desirable target, because of its recent confirmation of existence, which is responsible for the [2020 Physics Novel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2020/summary/) given to professors Ghez and Genzel.

## Formation of supermassive black holes

Although we have talked about some possible origins for a black hole in this article, we have not really talked about supermassive black holes, which are believed to exist in the center of every galaxy. Well, that is because we do not actually know their origin! Therefore, this is an important topic of research in the scientific community.

## Information loss paradox

I have said that black holes grow by accreting mass from their surroundings and that they slowly evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The matter absorbed by this object contains a lot of information (like mass, charge, angular momentum, and more), which we assume to be transferred to the black hole but inaccessible from the outside. However, Hawking radiation does not – for what we currently know – carry those pieces of information. Hence, when a black hole eventually evaporates, it appears that there is a loss of information, which is impossible according to the conservation of energy principle. The solution to this paradox? We still do not know!

We live in exciting times for talking about black holes; in a short period of time, humanity has detected the collision of a binary system (proving the existence of gravitational waves), taken the first direct image of a black hole, and proven that the center of our galaxy is one of those objects. If you are excited about this subject – like me – you may have seen this term being used a very often recently.

In this context, it is possible that "black hole" has become something mundane for most of us, who take for granted the knowledge we currently have about such an interesting object. In this post, I talk about some topics regarding black holes, in an attempt to exclude the mundanity of this expression.

# Origins: how are black holes created?

We are so used to thinking about the beginning and ending of things that the first question that usually arises when discussing black holes is about its origin. Well, there are more than one answer.

## Death of a star

The most common and accepted origin is the death of a star. When a star reaches the end of its life, there are some possible paths to be followed, like becoming a white dwarf, a neutron star or – the one we are in which we are interested – a black hole. The details of star evolution are way too complex to resume in just some phrases, so I plan on writing another post to dive into this topic.

In short words, the remaining content of a dead star will turn into a black hole if its mass is so big that not even the Pauli exclusion principle (which basically says that two particles cannot occupy the same place at the same time) can prevent the object from collapsing. In this scenario, the mass will keep collapsing eternally, having a volume that tends to zero and – therefore – a density that tends to infinity. The result is a point (no volume) with a huge density value, resulting in an immersive gravitational field; this point is called Singularity, but more on that later.

## The Big Bang

I said that the death of a star is the most **common** origin for black holes. In reality, all that is needed for a gravitational collapse to generate a black hole is a great density, which nowadays is found only on stars. However, there was a time in universe history when the space medium was full of high density objects, do you know what time was it? Well, if you said "The Big Bang", you are partially correct; to be more precise, it was in the *radiation dominated era* (less than one second after the Big Bang).

It is worth pointing out that we have no evidence that primordial black holes – name given to results from this origin – exist. Besides, since these objects are not created from stars, their mass can be below the solar mass, which makes the  detection of these black holes even more difficult.

## Lab collisions

By now, we have only talked about gravitational collapse (a lot of mass in a small volume) as a way to create black holes. However, it is also theoretically possible to create such an object by putting a lot of energy in a small volume (which makes sense if you remember that mass and energy are the same, but transformed). In order to accomplish this, we would have to accelerate particles (providing energy) and then collide them, which is basically what particle accelerators like the LHC do.

Be as it may, this act would require a lot of energy, making it unfeasible for our current resources. Furthermore, when talking about this topic, it is common to fear that some black hole is going to be generated in some science lab and destroy the Earth. Don't worry! Even if we were able to create such objects, they would be so small that they would evaporate almost instantaneously because of Hawking radiation (more on that later).

# Behavior: what do black holes do?

We have already talked about how black holes are formed, but what do they do after that? Do they stay put until the end of the universe? No! There are 2 main events in the "life" of a black hole.

## Growth (accretion of mass)
## Evaporation (Hawking radiation)

# Structure and properties: what are black holes made of?

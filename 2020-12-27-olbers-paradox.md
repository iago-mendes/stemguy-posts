	description: The color of the sky is something so natural to us that many people may think that "why is the night sky dark?" is a dumb question. However, its answer is more elaborated than most people would expect. In this post, I dive into the Olbers' Paradox, which asks this exact question.

The answer to the question "why is the night sky dark?" seems so obvious, right? "The night sky is dark because there is no Sun", many would say. However, this answer is wrong!

About 200 years ago, the astronomer Heinrich Olbers showed that the night sky should be as brilliant as the day sky, according to what the scientific community believed back then. This fact is known as the Olbers' paradox, which was first publically solved by the American writer Edgar Allan Poe.

Before talking specifically about the paradox, it is important to understand what the scientific community accepted as true back then. First, we have the **Cosmological Principle** — which, by the way, is still believed nowadays. Basically, it is the notion that, when viewed on a large enough scale, the universe spatial distribution is homogeneous and isotropic. This is sometimes summarized to the phrase "there is no privileged observer in the universe".

In general, this principle states that our universe is uniform, but there are 2 more specific consequences.

## "The universe is homogeneous"

Here, **homogeneity** has to do with positions, and, since we are considering a uniform universe, we have that all of them are similar. In other words, there are no preferred locations in the universe; it looks the same no matter where you set up your telescope.

## "The universe is isotropic"

In this scenario, **isotropy** is related to directions, and, just like the positions, we consider them to be the equivalent. In other words, there are no preferred directions in the universe; it looks the same no matter which way you point your telescope.

# Infinite and eternal static universe

Another accepted concept was the **Steady State Theory**, which is an alternative solution to the model of our universe. Basically, it states that the universe did not have a beginning; instead, it has always existed. Besides, this theory says that there is a frequent accretion of mass along with the expansion, maintaining the density of the universe constant.

# The question: why is the night sky dark?

Now that we have understood the concepts accepted by the scientific community at that time, we can talk about the paradox itself. The proposition is simple: if the universe is infinite and uniform, there should be at least one point of light for every line of vision in the sky. Therefore, if we consider all luminous points, we deduce that the sky should always be bright.

In other to better understand why that is the case, we can think of an analogy. Imagine you are in the middle of a vast and dense forest. In this case, for every direction at which you look (except for up and down, obviously), you would see a piece of tree. You would not be able to see any background outside the forest. If you take the trees to be stars and the "background" to be the "dark sky", you have understood the proposition.

Ok... now that it makes sense in our minds, we can address the question: why that is not true? Since we understand ourselves as people, we have seen the night sky as dark, not bright. So, what is going on?

# The answer: the Big Bang Theory

Well... we get the answer to this paradox when we adjust the concepts used. Nowadays, the most accepted model of our universe is the Big Bang Theory, which diverges in many ways from the Steady State theory. The main diversion is that the universe had a beginning, which changes drastically our proposition stated in the previous section. Another important factor to be considered is that the speed of light is constant and is the limit of information traffic in our universe.

With those 2 considerations, we can already answer the paradox: the light from more distant stars has not had enough time to arrive to us. Therefore, we can only see at night stars that are near enough so that their travel time to Earth is smaller than the age of the universe — approximately 14 billion years. As a consequence, we see the night sky as dark!

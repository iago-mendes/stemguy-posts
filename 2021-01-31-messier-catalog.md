	description: Did you know that stars, planets, and the Moon are not the only possible targets of observation? In fact, the most beautiful ones are Dark Sky Objects (or DSOs), which is the subject of this article. If you want to learn more about this topic and to see some famous DSOs, this is the right post for you.

When I take my telescope to show the night sky to inexperienced people, they usually want to look at stars. After I explain that stars are not magnified in a telescope because of their distance and dimensions, the reactions I receive tend to be of disappointment. After all, *"what else is there for us to observe?"* — many would say.

Well, that question is already answered if we consider some beautiful and interesting objects in our stellar system, like planets and the Moon. However, if that is not enough for you, let me tell you a secret: the most surprisingly charming celestial bodies are not included in those categories, because they are **deep sky objects**.

# What is a Deep Sky Object (DSO)?

What can you see when you look at the sky? Mainly stars, some planets, and — on a lucky day — the Moon, right? That is because they are really easy to see without any special equipment; we could say that they are *"shallow sky objects"*. That said, you may ask yourself: is there more than our eyes can see? Yes, there is!

Every celestial body that is not a star or part of the Solar System is classified as a **Deep Sky Object**, which is usually referred to as **DSO**. The most famous types of DSOs are **Nebulae** (huge clouds of gas and dust), **Star Clusters**, and **Galaxies**. In general, they are difficult (but not impossible) to see in the night sky with the naked eye, especially if you are in a large city with intense light pollution.

# Who was Charles Messier?

**Charles Messier** was a French astronomer who worked with hunting comets in the 18th century. Back then, there was a problem in the scientific community of distinguishing permanent from transient (with low period) objects in the sky. As a consequence, many astronomers used to end up studying an unidentified body only to discover that it was not a comet.

Seeing this situation, Messier decided to help the community by cataloging some of those permanent objects, which were DSOs. After some updates and help from other scientists, the **Messier Catalog** — as it became known — now contains 110 deep sky objects. From this quantity, 11 are nebulae, 55 are star clusters, and 39 are galaxies.

# Famous DSOs in the Messier catalog

Now that you have understood the context behind the deep sky objects, let's dive into the reason why most of you probably are here: to see some amazing images and to understand what they represent.

## The Crab Nebula (M1)

The Crab Nebula is the first object in the Messier catalog and is one of the most interesting as well. As the name suggests, this DSO is a nebula that is remnant from a supernova (death of a massive star), being home to a **neutron star** living in its center.

This explosion event was visible in Earth in 1054 and was noticed by Chinese astronomers, who viewed a *"guest star"* (as it was thought back then) even during the day. Nowadays, in a region with low light pollution, we can see M1 by aligning our equipments to the Taurus constellation.

## The Andromeda Galaxy (M31)

The Andromeda Galaxy is the 31st object in the Messier catalog and is one of the most famous bodies. It is the nearest galactic neighbor of our galaxy, and — along with the Milk Way — forms the Local Group, having some satellite galaxies around both central bodies. Besides, M31 is in **collision course** towards us!!! However, do not worry; we still have about 4.5 billion years of safety before that happens.

## The Orion Nebula (M42)

The Orion Nebula is the 42nd object in the Messier catalog and one of the first observations of amateur astronomers. It is a diffuse nebula and the closest stellar formation region from us. In the night sky, M42 can be spotted and distinguished from regular stars with the naked eye, being a spectacle when seen through a telescope.

## The Ring Nebula (M57)

The Ring Nebula is the 57th object in the Messier catalog and a **planetary nebula**. This type of structure is formed when a sun-like star dies and its core becomes a white dwarf, which can be seen in the center of every planetary nebula. M57 cannot be seen with the naked eye, but an intermediary telescope can spot this magnificent body in the Lyra constellation.

## The Sombrero Galaxy (M104)

Finally, the Sombrero Galaxy is the 104th object in the Messier catalog and is famous because of its shape that remembers a hat. Its characteristic symmetric ring is formed by dust, being the site of star formation in the galaxy. M104 is also beyond the visibility of the naked eye, but it can be seen through a small telescope pointing to its location in the Virgo constellation.

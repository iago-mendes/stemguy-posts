Back in 1965, two researchers from a telephone company were creating a signal receiver when they encountered a noise in the radio frequency coming from the sky. Normally, they tried to solve this problem by changing the equipment alignment, but... There was the noise again. Eventually, they figured out that this noisy wave was coming from everywhere! What could it possibly be?

Later, this was discovered to be the **Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB or CMBR)**, a signal that can be detected at any plane in the entire universe!

# Origin: the Big Bang

Ok, now that you've gotten excited about this topic... Let's start at the beginning: what is the origin of this radiation? The answer is related to the origin of the universe as we know today: the **Big Bang**.

During the early ages of the universe (up to about 400,000 years), everything was so hot that the universe itself was opaque, meaning that electromagnetic waves were scattered instead of passing through the medium. After that period, the universe became transparent, making it possible for those waves to spread in all directions.

One consequence of this transformation, was the emission of a high frequency energy that we today know as the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. However, due to the expansion of the universe this wave suffered the **Doppler Effect**, increasing its wave length (**red shifting**). Nowadays, this radiation is so elongated that it is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum.

# Evidences: analog televisions

It is common to hear phrases like "what good does knowing about this topic make in my life?" from people who are not STEM enthusiasts. Then, let me show you a fascinating fact about the CMBR that is present in almost everyone's life.

I know it isn't that common nowadays, but have you ever seen a TV glitching? Yes, I am talking about that black and white screen that you are thinking about. This usually happens when there is no cable connection and the antenna is not getting any transmission signal. Well, if there is no signal, shouldn't the screen be black (representing the absence of information)? Yes, it should.

With that, we conclude that there is some information being collected, but what is it, and where does it come from? If you are thinking about the Cosmic Microwave Background, you are perfectly right! Can you imagine it? An old TV that most of us have someday watched can detect a signal from the origin of our universe!!! That's crazy, right?

# Pop culture: Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)

This radiation is so fascinating that it is used in many fictional contents. Since I am a fan of the **MCU**, below I list 3 times when the CMBR is mentioned in this universe:

> [Spoiler alert]: If you haven't watched a media listed below, the information provided might spoil your watching experience.

## *WandaVision (2021)*: the Hex

In the [TV show](https://cinephix.com/tvshows/85271), *Darcy Lewis ([Kat Dennings](https://cinephix.com/celebrities/52852))* detects a "colossal amount of CMBR" coming from the Westview Anomaly. This signal is later used to broadcast the sitcom to S.W.O.R.D..

## *Avengers: Endgame (2019)*: the Snap

In the [movie](https://cinephix.com/movies/299534), *Rocket Raccoon ([Bradley Cooper](https://cinephix.com/celebrities/51329))* says that when *Thanos ([Josh Brolin](https://cinephix.com/celebrities/16851))* snapped his fingers, "Earth became ground zero for a power source of ridiculously cosmic proportions".

## *Fantastic Four (????)*: the powers

In the time I am writing this article, the only information about this [movie](https://cinephix.com/movies/617126) we have is its confirmation. Be as it may, the origin of the group's powers in the comics is from a CMBR storm while they are in space.

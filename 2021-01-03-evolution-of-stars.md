	description: Have you ever wanted to know what happens with those tiny luminous points in the sky that we call stars? Do you want to know about how they are formed, maintained and extinguished? Well, then this is the right post for you. In this article, I talk about evolution of stars, going from their birth to their death.

The most famous astronomical objects are stars, mainly because of their predominance in the night sky. Most people are used to seeing them as just luminous points and, for more advanced observers, to recognizing patterns like constellations and asterisms.

However, when we look at stars from an astrophysical perspective, those objects take another identity. In this scenario, they can be described as plasma spheroids kept together by their own gravity. Below, I talk about some of the most important stages in the life of different types of star, going from their formation to their destruction.

# Formation and initial ages: birth and childhood

Imagine an enormous cloud of gas and dust. Then, some regions of this cloud start to agglomerate, concentrating matter in the center and creating a disk format. With time, the result of this gravitational collapse is a hot dense star-like object: a protostar.

## Protostars

Once this structure is formed, the protostar keeps collapsing and, as a consequence of the **Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism**, increasing its temperature. A protostar can follow 2 paths: become a real star or a brown dwarf.

If we were to be more technical, this object becomes a star when nuclear fusions start happening in its core. However, if the protostar does not achieve the required temperature from the **Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism**, it does not start having those reactions and become a brown dwarf.

## Brown dwarfs

We could say that brown stars are protostars that failed to become real stars. Since they did not have nuclear fusions, their material is 100% Hydrogen, and they don't emit light.

# Main sequence: adulthood

Once a protostar starts having nuclear fusions in its center, it becomes a star and enters the main sequence. This is the longest period of life of stars; for reference, the Sun has been in the main sequence for 4.5 billion years and will keep in it for the same period.

## Nuclear fusions

While stars are in the main sequence, the nuclear fusions happening in their core converts Hydrogen to Helium. Those reactions are responsible for counter-balancing the gravity force (which tends to collapse) and, therefore, keeping the star at balance.

## Hertzsprung-Russell diagram

In astrophysics, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (commonly called H.R. diagram) relates the luminosity to the temperature of stars. In this diagram, the main sequence can be easily seen as a descendant diagonal.

Besides, we can understand the relation between color and size of stars. For example, a blue star is greater than a red one, considering that both are in the main sequence.

# Final ages: elderhood

Once the amount of Helium in the core increases, most stars at this point start another nuclear fusion process, now converting Helium into Carbon. After the amount of Carbon in the core increases, there are two common paths to be followed.

## Red giant stars

Stars with masses close to the Sun, become red giants when the Helium fusion starts. Their surface temperature decreases, which is why they become red. Furthermore, their radius increases, becoming "giant".

## Red supergiant stars and onion-like layers

Stars with about 40 times the mass of the Sun are able to continue the nuclear fusion reactions; hence, they convert Carbon into Neon, Neon into Oxygen, Oxygen into Silicon, and finally Silicon into Iron. This series of reaction stops at Iron because its nuclear fusion is an endothermic process, meaning that it would consume energy instead of provide it.

The result of those nuclear fusions is a lot of onion-like layers, each with a different element. Besides, in this process, those stars become red supergiants, which are really similar to red giants, but with a greater radius.

# Explosions: death

When there is not enough nuclear fusions in a star, its balance is completely lost. As a consequence, the outer layers of this star are thrown away, but this can happen in two ways.

## Planetary nebulas

The explosion of stars similar to the Sun is more controlled and generate what is known as planetary nebulas. This structure contains matter from the outer layers of red giants and has a relatively symmetrical format (which made some astronomers to confuse planetary nebulas with planets, originating this name).

## Supernovas

When red supergiants stop their nuclear fusions (with the Iron predominance in the core), the outer layers are thrown away in an enormous explosion called supernova. One interesting consequence of this process is the formation of elements with higher atomic numbers, up to Uranium (elements with higher atomic numbers can only be created synthetically).

# Remnant: corpse

After the explosion, the remnant core content can become three objects.

## White dwarfs

The remaining content from a planetary nebula is a white dwarf, having the size approximately equal to the Earth. White dwarfs are kept in balance due to the degeneracy pressure, which is a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle for electrons.

They don't produce more energy, emitting only the stored amount. Therefore, in theory, there could exist a black dwarf, which is basically a white dwarf that consumed all of its energy. However, the time needed for a black dwarf to be formed is greater than the age of the universe; hence, we cannot detect this type of object.

## Neutron stars

As a result of a supernova, the remaining content with mass similar to the Sun will become a neutron star. In the formation process, electrons and protons are fused, resting only neutrons in the atoms. The result is a small object — with a radius on the order of 10 km —, which is kept in balance by the **Pauli exclusion principle**.

## Black holes

Finally, if the remaining content of a supernova is greater than 2 solar masses, there is nothing to keep the balance. In this scenario, the mass will keep collapsing eternally, having a volume that tends to zero and – therefore – a density that tends to infinity. The result is a point (no volume) with a huge density value, resulting in an immense gravitational field.

If you want to learn more about black holes, I invite you to take a look at the article ["How do black holes work?"](https://stemguy.club/how-do-black-holes-work) in this blog.

# Disclaimer

Stellar evolution is a very complex subject, so there are many more cases that could be mentioned. However, since this blog is intended to show how interesting STEM is for non-experts in this area, I have only focused on the most important parts of the life of a star. Topics like variable stars and low mass stars can be discussed in future articles.

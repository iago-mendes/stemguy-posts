When you think about the "dark web" or the "deep web", what do imagine? A bunch of hackers doing illegal things on the internet? Well, this is the most common image in our culture, but that is not a good description. In fact, those terms — which are mean different things, as I explain below — are associated with a less accessible and more anonymous region of the internet.

We access the internet every day, but there is always something interesting about it that we still do not understand entirely. The dark web is included in that group, which is why I discuss it in this post.

# Internet onion-like layers

We are so used to just visiting the web via any browser that the complexity happening *"behind the scene"* usually passes unacknowledged by us. For example, the most common place to which people go when they want to get an answer is Google, right? It is even a usual expression to say that **"Google knows everything"**, but that is **not true!!!**

## Surface web

Everyone has heard about the metaphor of an iceberg: a small portion can be seen by everyone, while the larger part is hidden. Well, we can use this as an analogy to understand the layers of the internet. The internet that most of us use on a daily basis is called the **Surface web**, which can be compared with the tip of the iceberg.

It is composed by all indexed sites, which basically are pages that can be found in search engines — like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and others. On one hand, you do not need any special browser to access it or to have the domain saved; you can just type what you want to see in a search channel, and you are done. On the other hand, your privacy is not protected; your information can be easily accessed by websites, especially if you use products from companies famous for collecting data from users — such as Google and Facebook.

## Deep web

Diving a little deeper in our iceberg analogy, the submerged content can be associated with the **Deep web**.

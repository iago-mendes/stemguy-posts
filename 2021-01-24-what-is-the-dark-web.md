	description: Have you ever heard about the Dark web and wanted to know exactly what it is? Can you tell the difference between the "deep web" and the "dark web"? If so, stay tuned because, in this post, I talk about this darker side of the internet.

When you think about the "dark web" or the "deep web", what do imagine? A bunch of hackers doing illegal things on the internet? Well, this is the most common image in our culture, but that is not a good description. In fact, those terms — which mean different things, as I explain below — are associated with a less accessible and more anonymous region of the internet.

We access the internet every day, but there is always something interesting about it that we still do not understand entirely. The dark web is included in that group, which is why I discuss it in this post.

# Internet layers

We are so used to just visiting the web via any browser that the complexity happening *"behind the scene"* usually passes unacknowledged by us. For example, the most common place to which people go when they want to get an answer is Google, right? It is even a usual expression to say that **"Google knows everything"**, but that is **not true!!!**

## Surface web

Everyone has heard about the metaphor of an iceberg: a small portion can be seen by everyone, while the larger part is hidden. Well, we can use this as an analogy to understand the layers of the internet. The internet that most of us use on a daily basis is called the **Surface web**, which can be compared with the tip of the iceberg.

It is composed by all indexed sites, which basically are pages that can be found in search engines — like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and others. On one hand, you do not need any special browser to access it or to have the domain saved; you can just type what you want to see in a search channel, and you are done. On the other hand, your privacy is not protected; your information can be easily accessed by websites, especially if you use products from companies famous for collecting data from users — such as Google and Facebook.

## Deep web

Diving a little deeper in our iceberg analogy, the submerged content can be associated with the **Deep web**. This is a part of the internet that is more difficult to be found; they are not indexed by search engines. The main difference here is that you need to know the domain name — or to have it saved — in order to visit some website, which makes this layer less accessible.

Besides, this is where most data transactions happen on the internet. In this case, the information being transported is only accessible to those with the address — as said before — and the required credentials. Common examples of this are individual **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**, which asks for a key so that the navigation can occur.

## Dark web

Finally, we can talk about the most feared section of the internet: the **Dark web**. First, since it is a portion of the **Deep web**, all that was previously said is applicable to this part. Besides that, the most important word in this scenario is **anonymity**; in the Dark web, privacy is really important, so your identity is completely untraceable.

The idea of being anonymous on the internet was first conceived by governmental military, but nowadays anyone can browse through the Dark web. As a consequence, there are some illegal websites hosted in this section, which creates its common image in our culture — as said in the introduction.

# Privacy on the web

Now that you have understood how the internet is actually divided, let's dive into how your identity is handled on the web.

## IP addresses

The **Internet Protocol addresses** (or IP addresses) are our identities on the internet. Every communication between the client (you and me) and the server (remote computer) carries the IP addresses of all parties involved in this transmission. In a previous article, I talked about ["How does the internet work?"](https://stemguy.club/how-does-the-internet-work); if you have not seen it, and you want to understand more about the internet, I recommend reading it after you finish this one.

Therefore, if the communication is intercepted by some hacker — or even if the company responsible for the website you are visiting collects information from their clients —, your privacy is broken.  

## Virtual private network (VPN)

An awesome way of protecting yourself from this "exposure" is by using a **VPN** (Virtual Private Network), which has become something common in the last few years. By doing this, the IP address included in the public communications is from the VPN company you have chosen, which then privately sends the data to your IP address.

One could say that this is already an anonymous way of surfing the web, but remember that the VPN company can still access all your information. Besides, if some illegal activity is directed to them, they can prove the origin of it.

## Anonymous internet traffic

Now, imagine if the same VPN logic was applied to a larger scale in which the transmission does not have only one interception, but many locations spread throughout the world. Additionally, imagine that this huge network is not dependent on a company. Well, you have just imagined how the Dark web works!

The result of this chain of interceptions is that it is *almost impossible* to get the origin of some action on the internet. Therefore, this is the actually anonymous internet traffic.

### Tor software

After learning so much about this *"new"* section of the internet, you may want to access it. But how? First, you cannot use common browsers, like Chrome or Firefox, because they cannot handle the necessary encryption from the Dark web. Instead, you need to use a software created to this task, and the most famous one is [Tor](https://www.torproject.org).

**Tor** is a free and open-source software (FOSS) intended to *browse privately* and *defend yourself against tracking and surveillance* — as stated in the official website. As said before, nowadays anyone can surf the Dark web; all you have to do is download Tor and start navigating.

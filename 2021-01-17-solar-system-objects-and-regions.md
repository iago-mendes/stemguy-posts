	description: Can you tell the difference between asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, or other celestial objects? Those astronomical bodies make part of our home — the Solar System —, so we should be familiar with their characteristics, don't you agree? In this post, I talk about the most interesting objects and regions that compose our stellar system.

We all have heard about the Solar System, right? After all, it is our home in the vast universe. However, did you know that this system is composed of distinct object types and regions? Some of those components may sound more familiar — like planets and comets — and others may sound way too technical, like Kuiper belt.

# Objects

Most object types probably sound familiar to you, but let's dive into the characteristics of them and how they are defined.

## Asteroid

An asteroid is the simplest classification of astronomical objects. The only requirement to be classified as an asteroid is to orbit the Sun. Therefore, we can deduce that these are the predominant objects in our stellar system.

Good places to find asteroids are the stable **Lagrangian points** of each planet, in which the gravitational arrangement attracts near matter. In this context, the most famous group of asteroid are the **Trojans**, which share Jupiter's orbit.

### Meteor

When a celestial body — commonly an asteroid — enters the Earth atmosphere, it usually burns before hitting the ground. The result of this combustion is a flashy object in the sky popularly called a **falling star**, which is known in the scientific world as a meteor.

### Meteorite

Sometimes, not all the rocky content from meteors are destroyed in their journey. In that case, the remaining rocks are called meteorites.

## Dwarf planet

When compared to asteroids, dwarf planets add one more requirement; hence, to be in this category, an objects needs to orbit the Sun — just like an asteroid — and must have a spheroidal format. Since the format of celestial bodies depend on their masses, we can also say that dwarf planets have more mass than asteroids.

Currently, there are 5 dwarf planets cataloged in the Solar System, including the contradictory **Pluto**.

## Planet

Again, when compared to dwarf planets, planets add one more requirement; therefore, to be considered a planet, an object needs to fit the previous rules and to be capable of *"cleaning"* its orbit. In other words, a planet must eliminate the objects in its orbital region or make them orbit it.

This additional rule wad created by the [International Astronomical Union](https://www.iau.org) (IAU) in 2006 and is responsible for changing **Pluto**'s category from planet to dwarf planet.

### Natural satellite

In theory, every object that orbits a greater body could be classified as a natural satellite. However, this category is more commonly used for astronomical objects that orbit planets, like our dear Moon.

## Comet

The last important object type is the most distinct from the previous ones. Basically, comets are bodies made by rocks, gases, and ice that orbit the Sun with a great eccentricity (really elongated ellipses). When a comet gets close to the Sun, the radiation pressure creates two tails: one of dust and the other of gas.

# Regions

Now that we know the types of objects in our stellar system, let's learn about some interesting regions that group some of them.

## Asteroid belt

The Asteroid belt is a special region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. As the name suggests, it is mostly filled with asteroids, but it is also home to one dwarf planet: Ceres.

## Kuiper belt

The Kuiper belt is a **trans-neptunian** region, meaning that it is located after the orbit of **Neptune**. It contains asteroids, dwarf planets (4 of them) and short-period comets. The most famous object from this region is the Halley comet, which has a period of approximately 76 years.

## Oort cloud

Finally, the Oort cloud is the most distant region of the Solar System. While the previous regions take the forms of disks, this region has a spheroidal format. It houses mostly asteroids and long-period comets. The recently-famous NEOWISE comet comes from the Oort cloud and has a period of approximately 6,766 years (crazy, right?).

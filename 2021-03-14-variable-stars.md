	description: Have you ever heard that variable stars (astronomical objects whose brightness oscillates periodically) can be used for measuring distances in the great vastness of the Universe? And did you know that these tiny points in the sky can reveal important data even for amateur astronomers, only by using a telescope and a computer? If you got curious about this fascinating kind of star, you will enjoy reading this article!

# What are stars?

In order to understand how variable stars pulsate (and how this leads to some important discoveries in science), we will begin by recapitulating the physics behind all stellar bodies.

To put it in a nutshell, stars are self-gravitating bodies made of plasma (a **VERY** hot gas that has lost its electrons) whose energy is generated due to nuclear fusion reactions. These reactions happen when the nuclei of atoms merge to form the nucleus of another chemical element, but a slight fraction of mass is *"lost"* during the process.

Well, we all know that mass does not simply disappear — so that's when the famous Einstein Equation (**E=mc²**) comes to explain that this mass was actually transformed into energy! Over the course of billions of years, this continuous process of generation of new chemical elements changes a lot of stellar properties, such as temperature, pressure, and luminosity, and depending on the proportions of these changes, the star can enter a stage of its life called **instability trip**!

If you are interested in discovering more about the nature of all stars, I invite you to read [this post](https://stemguy.club/p/evolution-of-stars-from-birth-to-death), in which we talk about stellar formation, evolution, and death!

# Instability trip

In the instability trip, stars begin to behave similarly to a spring that was compressed and then released: its radius increases and decreases periodically, changing its intrinsic brightness.

This oscillation can be simplified as follows: when the star radius is lower, its internal gas is more compressed and absorbs more heat, which ionizes the particles and results in great internal pressure. This pressure forces the external gas layers out, and at this point, the star gets bigger and bigger — but as the radius increases, the particles lose energy and cool down, slowing the expansion. When the gas is sufficiently cool, the own stellar gravity attracts the layers to the center, and the pulsation cycle starts over!

# Types of variable stars

There are two important kinds of stars that follow the process described above: **Cepheids** and **RR Lyrae Variables**.

## Cepheids

Cepheids can be considered as giant or supergiant stars that experience a great change in luminosity regularly; their cycles can range from one to a hundred days. The first star discovered to behave this way was **Delta Cephei**, and it was first classified as a variable by the English astronomer **Jonh Goodricke** in 1784.
 
## RR Lyrae Variables

RR Lyrae Variables, on the other hand, are much smaller than Cepheids, and their pulsation cycles usually range from four hours to one day. In 1901, the Scottish astronomer **Williamina Fleming** discovered that the eponymous star **RR Lyrae** suffered variations in its brightness, which was the initial point to the classification of thousands of stars in the following years.

# Measuring distances with variable stars

By analyzing the variable stars in the **Magellanic Clouds**, the American astronomer **Henrietta Swan Leavitt** discovered a strong correlation between the object's total luminosity (the total amount of energy produced by them) and their pulsation time! This is typically referred to as the **period-luminosity relationship**.

Now, that's when the magic occurs: we know that luminous bodies irradiate their energy according to the distance from observers — the farther away you are from them, the lesser is the energy you receive — so we can determine how bright a variable star seems to us in Earth with a piece of equipment capable of measuring light intensity (a photometer, for example). Then, just by observing how long it takes for the star to pulsate, we can infer its total luminosity and compare it with its brightness as seen from Earth — and with some simple mathematics, we get an accurate prediction of how far away the object is from us!

There are plenty of organizations around the globe interested in finding and cataloging variable stars, such as the [American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO)](https://www.aavso.org) and the [British Astronomical Society (BAA)](https://britastro.org).

Besides, to provide an example of how amateur astronomers can proceed in this task (and contribute to the development of science while still having fun), we can begin with a modest setup: a telescope in the equatorial mount to follow Earth's rotation, a telephoto lens to amplify the system's optical power and a computer with the IRIS software installed. After searching for the evidence of variable stars, astronomers track them with telescopes during some pulsation cycles, while plotting their light curves in the software Iris. By analyzing the graphs, they infer all the essential data: apparent brightness from Earth, the period of pulsation, and absolute luminosity (which is calculated by the **period-luminosity relation**, remember?).

All this fascinating work of observation and data analysis converge to this point, and with the help of the **Distance Modulus equation**, it is then possible to find the distance of star clusters, nebulae, and even galaxies! The universe is indeed really beautiful and intriguing, isn't it?

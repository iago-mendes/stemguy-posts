	description: You access the internet every day, but do you know how it actually works? Would you believe if I tell you that the whole is connected via cables in order for you to post on Instagram and others see it? Well, that is — among other things — what keeps the internet live.

We are all connected. Nowadays, you can communicate with people in the other side of Earth in a matter of seconds. This is possible because of the internet, which has become presented in the life of most of us. It has even become a surprising fact how the children born in this era are able to understand technology and, consequently, the internet so easily.

In this sense, a lot of us depend on the internet for many activities, like working, studying or even having fun. This is true especially after spending almost all 2020 in isolation from the world. However, many people do not quite understand how this so important modern feature (the internet) works. Well, if you want to learn about it, you are in the right place.

# Basic components

Before diving into the technical details of this topic, it is important to understand the basic concepts, especially the division of tasks present in a communication. In order to make this more familiar, I will use an analogy of sending/receiving a mail to explain the process of sending/receiving some information on the internet (for example, a blog article like this one).

## Servers: post offices

To send a mail, you need to go to a post office, which will be in charge of controlling the mail path until the destination, right? Well, you could say that servers are the "post offices" of the internet. They control what is sent and received.

For example, when I sent this article to the server I own, its information is stored; then, when some reader — like you — requests that article, the same server is responsible for treating and sending this piece of information to your browser.

## Cables and signals: postal workers

Okay... I have explained that servers are responsible for controlling information, but how does it actually travel from some remote machine to your browser? Using cables and signals, of course! This is shocking to people who have not heard about this before, but the whole world is filled with lots of cables that connect houses, cities, and countries.

The work done in this division can be associated as a postman's work, who is responsible to take a mail from an origin and deliver it to a destiny. This traffic process has a lot of more cool facts, so I talk more about it in the next section.

## Clients: houses

Well, this is the easiest component to explain: it is you! In principle, all **front-end applications** communicate directly with the client. If you would like to learn more about the fundamentals of websites, I invite you to read the article ["What is needed for a website to work?"](https://stemguy.club/what-is-needed-for-a-website-to-work) in this blog.

In our analogy, both the sender and recipient are clients. For example, when I published this article, I had to access the admin system of the STEM Guy blog and send the information to the server. Then, when you visited this page, the same server sent you the data, as I have already explained. Therefore, we both are clients in this scenario.

# Information transmission

In the previous section, I talked about the information traffic a little, but now it is time to dive into it! This process has some fascinating facts, so let's start.

## Packets

You know that some information we access online can be pretty heavy, right? This is especially true for images, which are known for making the user experience worse across the web. How does the internet handle that? By breaking the information into pieces! Those small parts are called packets, which are reconstructed in the same order when the client receives the complete information.

## Copper and optical cables

Remember that I said that the world is connected via cables? This may sound strange because nowadays we are so used to the wireless technology, but we still rely a lot on the old physical cables. Now, of course the current cables are way more advanced, having the optical fiber technology as a way to speed the traffic.

The copper cables are slower, but still very common around the world when an enormously high speed is not required. In essence, optical cables connect countries, big data centers and internet providers, which are connected to the rest of the world via either cable.

### Submarine cables

When I said that countries are connected via cables, you may have started wondering how that would work for countries separated by an ocean. Well, the answer continues the same. There are huge optical cables at the bottom of the ocean!!! Those submarine cables are responsible for connecting regions with no terrestrial connection.

When considering such cables, there are some funny concerns that must be figured out. The most interesting one is about sharks! Even tough it may sound ridiculous, it is important to be prepared for shark bites on submarine cables; a shark should not be able to break the internet, right? Companies responsible for this job — like [SubCom](https://www.subcom.com) — have already taken care of reinforcing their cables, so do not worry.

## Radio waves

By now, I have mainly talked only about cable connections, but you probably are not connected to a cable if you are using your smartphone or a laptop. That is because you are probably connected to a Wi-Fi or using cellular data. They both use radio waves to transmit information to you.

# Identification

<Img url='https://api.stemguy.club/uploads/google.png-168aa83c73b10b2d6c271a0355215344.png' alt='Google id card' credit='Designed using business vector created by freepik - www.freepik.com' creditLink='https://www.freepik.com/vectors/business' width=1500 height=1286 />

Now that we have talked about the fairly complex information traffic, you may be wondering how does a server not get confused about where to send a certain piece of data. In order to avoid this problem, it is important to have a good identification system.

## IP addresses

The main feature responsible to identify everything on the internet is the **IP address**, which is unique to internet connection around the world. For example, the IP address 172.271.162.174 identifies the main Google website. In the analogy we created in the beginning of this article, this would be equivalent to house address, which identify the post office and both the sender and the recipient.

## Domain names

However, when you want to search something on Google, you do not have to remember this ugly sequence of numbers, right? This is why **domain names** exist, making it easy to remember the addresses we like. For example, if you want to read some interesting article about science and technology, you can type [stemguy.club](https://stemguy.club), and you are done. Easy just like that! The same stands for the domain name [google.com](https://www.google.com), which points to the IP address 172.271.162.174.

In our analogy, this would be like remembering only the name of someone, but not his/her home address.

## ICANN

In the old days, when you just knew the name of someone, you would look at an address book to find out this person's home address, right? The same process needs to happen when we use domain names as identifications, because the communication must occur with IP addresses. In this sense, it is needed an organization to control all registered domains and their respective IP address.

This organization exists and its name is [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org), or just **ICANN**. In principle, the information of the IP address related to some domain name is stored in a **DNS server**, but that would be more technical talking than needed.

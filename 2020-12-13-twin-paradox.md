Relativity is a topic that most people consider to be complex, especially because of the counterintuitive scenarios that can be analyzed. This is the reason for existing so many "fake" paradoxes, which basically are situations that contradict our common sense but are perfectly fine according to the physics of the process.

In this sense, there are many "relativity paradoxes" that can be found on the internet that are not really paradoxes (meaning that there is a solution for it). One famous example of this is the twin paradox: a relativistic event (near the speed of light) involving time dilation. In this post, I go over all the details — without diving into the math, which can be boring for some people — regarding this problem.

# Thought experiment example

Well, let's start by creating an example that arises this "paradox". Imagine 2 twin brothers, one being an astronaut who will travel to somewhere distant, like the Alpha Centauri star system and return to Earth. In order to avoid non-exact numbers, let's approximate the distance between Earth and Alpha Centauri to be **4 light-years**. Besides, consider that the astronaut brother will travel at **80%** the speed of light.

The question that puzzles a lot of people is "taking into account time dilation effects, when the astronaut brother return to Earth, which brother is older?".

# Why do people think this is a paradox?

To understand why people think this is a paradox, let's attempt to answer the question with 2 approaches: in the Earth's and in the astronaut's frame of reference.
 
Starting with the most obvious, we have the Earth's frame, in which the astronaut moves towards Alpha Centauri and then backwards. Using the relativistic formulas for time dilation (not shown in here), we get that the time measured by a stationary observer on Earth would be **10 years**, while the time measured by a moving observer — like the astronaut — would be **6 years**. Therefore, we would say that the astronaut brother aged **6 years** while the other brother aged **10 years**, concluding that the **non-astronaut brother is older**.

Now, let's look at the second approach. If you are not familiar with this frame change, it is something really normal in Physics, and we must have the same result as before; otherwise, it is a paradox. If we look at the astronaut's frame of reference, we can say that the "universe" (which here means the Earth-Alpha Centauri system) is moving while he is stationary. In this approach, the times calculated before would be reversed, having the astronaut brother aging **10 years** and the other brother aging **6 years**. Therefore, we conclude that the **astronaut brother is older**.

Wait... What? That is impossible, right? How can we have two different results for the same experiment? Well... This is the puzzling thing about "paradox".

# Why it is not a paradox?

Before I explain to you in detail, I am going to go ahead and say that our second approach was wrong. Now, we got to understand why it is wrong. The short explanation is that the astronaut had to turn around (accelerate) in order to return to Earth, and weird things happen with time in accelerating frames of reference. In other words, in the astronaut's frame, people on Earth aged **3 years** on his way to Alpha Centauri and **3 years** on his way back, but in the brief moment he turned around (consider it to be instantaneous here), those same people aged **4 years**!

The more complex explanation involves one of the most unfamiliar principles of this subject: relativity of simultaneity. This concept usually carries along the saying that "rear clocks are set ahead" or that "distant simultaneity is not absolute", which basically means that two events happening at the same time in one frame of reference may not be simultaneous in another. Therefore, when the astronaut turns around, he changes his frame of reference and, hence, the reading on clocks (or their own biological clocks) is changed.

In order to better understand this justification, let's assume that the astronaut can read imaginary clocks in his ship and in Earth. On the end of his way to Alpha Centauri, the Earth's clock would read **3 years** and the ship's clock would read **5**. At the end of his turn around, although there was no significant pass of time, the readings change to, respectively, **7 years** and **1 year**. Finally, when he returns to Earth, the reading are, respectively, **10 years** and **6 years**, as expected.

# The solution: which brother is older?

As shown in the previous section, in both frames of reference, the astronaut brother ages **6 years** while the other brother ages **10 years**. Therefore, we conclude that the **non-astronaut brother is older**!
